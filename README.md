Determining time from a photo of an analog clock

# Project description
2 options for solving the problem of determining time from a photo of an analog clock were worked out:
1. Segmentation of clock hands, detection of dial numbers, determination of time through the use of the angle of the hands.
2. Training Resnacht 50 on a dataset of over 200,000 images (12 hours 60 minutes = 720 image classes).
