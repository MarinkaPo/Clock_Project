# :alarm_clock: :clock6: :watch: Clock_Project
The main question was - how to determine time from a photo of an analog clock using neural networks.

# Project description
2 options for solving the problem were worked out:
1. Trigonometric method:

segmentation of clock hands, detection of dial numbers and time determination through the use of the angle of the hands.

2. ResNext50 classification:

training ResNext50 on a dataset of over 200,000 images (720 image classes).
