Determining time from a photo of an analog clock

# Project description
2 options for solving the problem of determining time from a photo of an analog clock were worked out:
1. Trigonometric method:

segmentation of clock hands, detection of dial numbers and time determination through the use of the angle of the hands.

2. ResNext50 classification:

training ResNext50 on a dataset of over 200,000 images (12 hours x 60 minutes = 720 image classes).
